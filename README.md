## Documentation for Business Card

I created this business card as my first ever coding project in HTML & CSS for my Web Typography class at UMass Dartmouth. Initially, I wanted the business card to be able to flip in a 3D space. Unfortunately, as a beginner, it was rather ambitious for my first ever writing in HTML. As an illustrator, I struggle to get the ideas from my head onto a space in front of me, but it was so much easier with coding. I made my mock-up using Figma and referenced it the entire time I was coding, making my work match perfectly the idea I had in my head. I used Macondo & Macondo Swash Caps as it reminded me slighlty of written Celtic languages, but with much more legibility and compatability.
